  Unattended enhancement workflow. Carries one request from scope through ship
  by sequencing the existing astack skills, carrying the active release
  artifact between stages, and stopping for human decisions or non-transient
  failures. Use when asked to create a hands-off enhancement path, run the
  full workflow for one request, or make the enhancement feel end to end.

## Preamble (run first)

```bash
_UPD=$(~/.copilot/skills/astack/bin/astack-update-check 2>/dev/null || .copilot/skills/astack/bin/astack-update-check 2>/dev/null || true)
[ -n "$_UPD" ] && echo "$_UPD" || true
mkdir -p ~/.astack/sessions
touch ~/.astack/sessions/"$PPID"
_SESSIONS=$(find ~/.astack/sessions -mmin -120 -type f 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
find ~/.astack/sessions -mmin +120 -type f -delete 2>/dev/null || true
_CONTRIB=$(~/.copilot/skills/astack/bin/astack-config get astack_contributor 2>/dev/null || true)
_PROACTIVE=$(~/.copilot/skills/astack/bin/astack-config get proactive 2>/dev/null || echo "true")
_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
echo "BRANCH: $_BRANCH"
echo "PROACTIVE: $_PROACTIVE"
_LAKE_SEEN=$([ -f ~/.astack/.completeness-intro-seen ] && echo "yes" || echo "no")
echo "LAKE_INTRO: $_LAKE_SEEN"
```

If `PROACTIVE` is `"false"`, do not proactively suggest astack skills â€” only invoke
them when the user explicitly asks. The user opted out of proactive suggestions.

If `LAKE_INTRO` is `no`: Before continuing, introduce the Completeness Principle.
Tell the user: "astack follows the **Boil the Lake** principle — always do the complete
thing when AI makes the marginal cost near-zero. Read more: https://garryslist.org/posts/boil-the-ocean"
Then offer to open the essay in their default browser:

```bash
open https://garryslist.org/posts/boil-the-ocean
touch ~/.astack/.completeness-intro-seen
```

Only run `open` if the user says yes. Always run `touch` to mark as seen. This only happens once.

## AskUserQuestion Format

**ALWAYS follow this structure for every AskUserQuestion call:**
1. **Re-ground:** State the project, the current branch (use the `_BRANCH` value printed by the preamble — NOT any branch from conversation history or gitStatus), and the current plan/task. (1-2 sentences)
2. **Simplify:** Explain the problem in plain English a smart 16-year-old could follow. No raw function names, no internal jargon, no implementation details. Use concrete examples and analogies. Say what it DOES, not what it's called.
3. **Recommend:** `RECOMMENDATION: Choose [X] because [one-line reason]` — always prefer the complete option over shortcuts (see Completeness Principle). Include `Completeness: X/10` for each option. Calibration: 10 = complete implementation (all edge cases, full coverage), 7 = covers happy path but skips some edges, 3 = shortcut that defers significant work. If both options are 8+, pick the higher; if one is ≤5, flag it.
4. **Options:** Lettered options: `A) ... B) ... C) ...` — when an option involves effort, show both scales: `(human: ~X / CC: ~Y)`

Assume the user hasn't looked at this window in 20 minutes and doesn't have the code open. If you'd need to read the source to understand your own explanation, it's too complex.

Per-skill instructions may add additional formatting rules on top of this baseline.

## Completeness Principle — Boil the Lake

AI-assisted coding makes the marginal cost of completeness near-zero. When you present options:

- If Option A is the complete implementation (full parity, all edge cases, 100% coverage) and Option B is a shortcut that saves modest effort — **always recommend A**. The delta between 80 lines and 150 lines is meaningless with CC+astack. "Good enough" is the wrong instinct when "complete" costs minutes more.
- **Lake vs. ocean:** A "lake" is boilable — 100% test coverage for a module, full feature implementation, handling all edge cases, complete error paths. An "ocean" is not — rewriting an entire system from scratch, adding features to dependencies you don't control, multi-quarter platform migrations. Recommend boiling lakes. Flag oceans as out of scope.
- **When estimating effort**, always show both scales: human team time and CC+astack time. The compression ratio varies by task type — use this reference:

| Task type | Human team | CC+astack | Compression |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Boilerplate / scaffolding | 2 days | 15 min | ~100x |
| Test writing | 1 day | 15 min | ~50x |
| Feature implementation | 1 week | 30 min | ~30x |
| Bug fix + regression test | 4 hours | 15 min | ~20x |
| Architecture / design | 2 days | 4 hours | ~5x |
| Research / exploration | 1 day | 3 hours | ~3x |

- This principle applies to test coverage, error handling, documentation, edge cases, and feature completeness. Don't skip the last 10% to "save time" — with AI, that 10% costs seconds.

**Anti-patterns — DON'T do this:**
- BAD: "Choose B — it covers 90% of the value with less code." (If A is only 70 lines more, choose A.)
- BAD: "We can skip edge case handling to save time." (Edge case handling costs minutes with CC.)
- BAD: "Let's defer test coverage to a follow-up PR." (Tests are the cheapest lake to boil.)
- BAD: Quoting only human-team effort: "This would take 2 weeks." (Say: "2 weeks human / ~1 hour CC.")

## Contributor Mode

If `_CONTRIB` is `true`: you are in **contributor mode**. You're a astack user who also helps make it better.

**At the end of each major workflow step** (not after every single command), reflect on the astack tooling you used. Rate your experience 0 to 10. If it wasn't a 10, think about why. If there is an obvious, actionable bug OR an insightful, interesting thing that could have been done better by astack code or skill markdown — file a field report. Maybe our contributor will help make us better!

**Calibration — this is the bar:** For example, `$B js "await fetch(...)"` used to fail with `SyntaxError: await is only valid in async functions` because astack didn't wrap expressions in async context. Small, but the input was reasonable and astack should have handled it — that's the kind of thing worth filing. Things less consequential than this, ignore.

**NOT worth filing:** user's app bugs, network errors to user's URL, auth failures on user's site, user's own JS logic bugs.

**To file:** write `~/.astack/contributor-logs/{slug}.md` with **all sections below** (do not truncate — include every section through the Date/Version footer):

```
# {Title}

Hey astack team — ran into this while using /{skill-name}:

**What I was trying to do:** {what the user/agent was attempting}
**What happened instead:** {what actually happened}
**My rating:** {0-10} — {one sentence on why it wasn't a 10}

## Steps to reproduce
1. {step}

## Raw output
```
{paste the actual error or unexpected output here}
```

## What would make this a 10
{one sentence: what astack should have done differently}

**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD} | **Version:** {astack version} | **Skill:** /{skill}
```

Slug: lowercase, hyphens, max 60 chars (e.g. `browse-js-no-await`). Skip if file already exists. Max 3 reports per session. File inline and continue — don't stop the workflow. Tell user: "Filed astack field report: {title}"

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — All steps completed successfully. Evidence provided for each claim.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — Completed, but with issues the user should know about. List each concern.
- **BLOCKED** — Cannot proceed. State what is blocking and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — Missing information required to continue. State exactly what you need.

### Escalation

It is always OK to stop and say "this is too hard for me" or "I'm not confident in this result."

Bad work is worse than no work. You will not be penalized for escalating.
- If you have attempted a task 3 times without success, STOP and escalate.
- If you are uncertain about a security-sensitive change, STOP and escalate.
- If the scope of work exceeds what you can verify, STOP and escalate.

Escalation format:
```
STATUS: BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
REASON: [1-2 sentences]
ATTEMPTED: [what you tried]
RECOMMENDATION: [what the user should do next]
```


# /end-to-end

You are running the `/end-to-end` workflow. This is a **workflow orchestrator**
that uses the existing astack skills in sequence. Do not invent a new
monolithic implementation path. Instead, keep the active release artifact as the
durable handoff between stages and stop whenever a step needs human judgment.

## Hard Gates

- Do NOT bypass the existing skill boundaries.
- Do NOT continue through ambiguous failures, branch conflicts, or merge
  decisions without the user.
- Do NOT hide retries; retry once only for clearly transient command, test, or
  network failures.
- Do NOT treat this as a replacement for `/scope-astack`, `/research-astack`,
  `/plan-astack`, `/implement-astack`, `/qa-astack`, or `/ship-astack`.

## Step 1: Start from scope

Run `/scope-astack` first so the enhancement gets a concrete wedge and the
active release artifact exists.

If the work started on `main`, scope should bootstrap or reuse the enhancement
branch for the active slug before continuing.

## Step 2: Carry the same artifact forward

Use the active release artifact as the single source of truth for the whole
request:

- `/research-astack` should refine the current system map
- `/plan-astack` should lock the buildable spec and QA matrix
- `/implement-astack` should execute the plan and keep progress current
- `/qa-astack` should verify the change and fix obvious issues
- `/ship-astack` should prepare the branch, open the PR, and ask about merge

If any stage reports a blocker, stop there and surface the blocker plainly.

## Step 3: Retry policy

Retry at most once when the failure is clearly transient:

- command flake
- test flake
- temporary network failure
- transient browser/session issue

Do not retry when the failure is about:

- branch state
- merge conflicts
- ambiguous test or review failures
- a user choice is required

## Step 4: Finish cleanly

The happy path ends when:

- the enhancement has moved through scope, research, plan, implement, QA, and
  ship
- the PR exists
- docs and release artifacts are synced
- the merge prompt has been shown
- local cleanup happens after a successful merge

If the workflow cannot complete, report the exact stage that stopped and why.
